    <blockquote> These <span class="red">User Personas</span> were created to get an idea of the demographic that vending machines have, and it's a pretty vast demographic. So, I made two opposing personas to help meet the needs of such polarized sides. </blockquote>

<div class="aboutcraig">
    <p> Craig works alone the majority of the time. He has coworkers and someone to answer to, but no friends. He says it's because he has no time. He'd rather be working to improve industry. His father an accomplished business man of the people. Though Craig seems like a cold speedster, he does care about the people that come to the firm. They tell him stories and though he is typing away furiously with a pressed brow, he is listening to them. Craig has one other love, chocolate. His father would bring him a chocolate bar every Friday as a child. If his grades started to fall, he would not get the bar until he saw improvement. The chocolate was a progress tool.  The chocolate came from a local candy Shoppe. It is now closed and is the reason he started working in the business field to make sure people like those who owned the candy Shoppe would not fall to the merciless hands of debtors, bankers, and the IRS. Craig likes getting what he asks for the first time and hates to make the wrong choice. He likes to do research with very specific questions involved. As a person, Craig prefers the nicer, more high-tech things in life. The snack machine in the breakroom is just too outdated to seem appetizing and is why he tends to skip it on his way to lunch. Craig also has big hands so that makes the tiny door of the snack machine its own challenge. If only there were an automatic door just to open and close at the weight of a snack or drink.  </p>

<p>
    Amina lives the average life of an American teen. She parties with her friends some weekends and there's always drama in high school. She tries to stay out of trouble but will stand up for those she cares about. This ties into her self-gratification attribute. She says what she means and doesn’t sugarcoat anything. Her parents have stable well-paying jobs but it wasn’t always this way. Her father, after returning from the Navy when Amina was 14, had trouble finding work until several months later. For this and other reasons like it, she doesn't take what she is given for granted and was delighted when her parents bought her a new iPhone X. Her mother, an established local food critique is where Amina gets her no-holds-barred spirit and writing abilities. She gets her honesty and confidence from her father. As a teenager, Amina often craves a pick-me-up, a snack or a drink. Though this may be the case, Amina is very self-conscious about the foods she's eating. She takes her image very seriously as a young blogger and internet personality and is highly aware of cyber-bullying. When in contact with a snack machine, she knows what flavors she wants to enjoy. What she doesn’t always know is which snack she'll get. What she hates to do is sit there ogling the machine until she makes a decision or else she'll lose interest and would rather be doing something else like vlogging.  She also runs into problems of recommending great snacks to her followers. There are times where the flavors are region specific, as well. Amina likes easy access almost as much as she likes free-speech. In stating this, she hates the newest Snapchat update; its user interface is way out of the norm.
